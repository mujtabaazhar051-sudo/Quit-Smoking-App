        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            My name is Mujtaba, a medical graduate from Pakistan, and this project comes from a very personal place in my heart. I’ve seen people I care about struggle with smoking, and I’ve also lost loved ones to its effects. In hospitals, I’ve sat with patients gasping for air because of chronic lung disease, and I’ve seen families shattered by cancers that began with a cigarette. Those moments have stayed with me and made me realize how much pain something as small as a pack of cigarettes can bring into people’s lives, even breaking families apart.
I know quitting isn’t easy. For many, it’s one of the hardest battles they’ll ever face. But I also believe it’s never too late. With the right support, encouragement, and tools, anyone can take back control of their health. That’s why I built this app in both English and Urdu, to make it simple, accessible, and meaningful for everyone in Pakistan.
This app was created in collaboration with pulmonologists and respiratory therapists from both Pakistan and the United States, ensuring that every feature is backed by medical expertise and tailored to the unique challenges people here face.
This isn’t just an app to me, it’s a promise that no one should feel alone in their fight to quit smoking. If this app helps even one person take that first step toward a healthier, longer life, then I’ll know it was worth creating.
The app is still in its early stages, and we will continue improving it to better support you.
Good luck with your journey to quit smoking, you’re not alone.
